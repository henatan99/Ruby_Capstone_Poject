# Ruby_Capstone_Poject
This a Ruby Capstone project from the Microverse Ruby curriculum. The purpose of this project is to build a custom linter program for the documentation of a specific file type. 

## Description 
This custom linter program is developed to catch standard documentation offenses of ruby files. 

### Indentation Offenses
The program compares the actual and the standard indentation of a line in code and puts an error message with line number 

### Empty line before a method
The program will look before the new method opening tag and if there is no newline it puts an error message

### Unecessary empty line
The program will loop through each line and gives an error message when it gets one which is not before a new method tag

### Unnecessary white space detected
The program will catch unnecessary white space in a line and loops through each line and give comments with line number and column number information

## Unclosed tag detection
The program checks for balance of line standard indentation level and checks if there is an unclosed tab and puts error message when one founds

## line size detection
The program will count the size of each line strings and puts an error message when it exceeds the set maximum

## Method length detection
The program will count the length of each method blocks and puts an error message when it exceeds the set maximum
